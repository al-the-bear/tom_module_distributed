TODO: Please create a dist_ledger_overview_design.md which explains the distributed operation ledger ideas and concepts, shows the "big picture" of operations across several participants and ends with the api and a short (5-10 lines)  explanation for each method.

TODO: Please create a dist_ledger_simulator.md that explains how the simulator works, how to configure scenarios and ends with a detailed implementation description.

TODO: Please create a dist_ledger_user_guide.md that explains in details how to use the ledger api on both caller and callee side, what happens when an error occurs and how it is signalled and how cleanup happens in case of failure. I think the cleanup sequence may still need further design.
